<p>A particle system simulates physical interactions between particles in the system. Each particle has the following basic attributes: mass $m$, position $x$, velocity $v$, and force $f$. One of the fundamental constraints is the phase space equation:</p>

<p>$$
[x, v]' = [v, f/m]
$$</p>

<p>Several types of forces can be modeled in the system:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unary force: force that acts on each particle independently, e.g. gravity, wind, drag, etc.</li>
<li>n-ary force: force that involves multiple particles in the system, e.g. springs.</li>
<li>Spatial interaction: e.g. attraction or repulsion that acts on all pairs of particles.</li>
</ul>

<p>A particle system can model many interesting scenes, such as burning fire, fireworks, hair, cloth, fluid, etc.</p>

<a id="plan" class="anchor" href="#plan" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Plan</h2>

<ul>
<li>I would like to implement the system in javascript, and render it on HTML5 canvas.</li>
<li>I would start with some warm-up tasks like fire, fireworks, which models unary forces only. In the meanwhile, I will familiarize myself with WebGL interfaces.</li>
<li>Then I would proceeds to model more complicated systems, such as hair and cloth, which also involves binary forces between particles.</li>
<li>If time permits, I would try more advanced models, such as fluid and smoke.</li>
</ul>
