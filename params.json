Each particle has the following basic attributes: mass $m$, position $x$, velocity $v$, and force $f$. One of the fundamental constraints is the phase space equation:\r\n\r\n$$\r\n[x, v]' = [v, f/m]\r\n$$\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral types of forces can be modeled in the system:\r\n\r\n* Unary force: force that acts on each particle independently, e.g. gravity, wind, drag, etc.\r\n* n-ary force: force that involves multiple particles in the system, e.g. springs.\r\n* Spatial interaction: e.g. attraction or repulsion that acts on all pairs of particles.\r\n\r\nA particle system can model many interesting scenes, such as burning fire, fireworks, hair, cloth, fluid, etc.\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\n* I would like to implement the system in javascript, and render it on HTML5 canvas.\r\n* I would start with some warm-up tasks like fire, fireworks, which models unary forces only. In the meanwhile, I will familiarize myself with WebGL interfaces.\r\n* Then I would proceeds to model more complicated systems, such as hair and cloth, which also involves binary forces between particles.\r\n* If time permits, I would try more advanced models, such as fluid and smoke.\r\n",
